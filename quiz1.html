      <dl>
        <dt>What can occur if information is produced from incorrect or incomplete data?</dt>
        <dd>The information will not be accurate, and may not represent the whole picture.</dd>

        <dt>Why is it important to ensure the data is accurate?</dt>
        <dd>If the data is not accurate, it will not be useful for producing information.</dd>

        <dt>What are the properties of usable data?</dt>
        <dd>It should be: Relevant, Accurate, Free from bias, Reliable, Timely, Adequately sampled. (FAR RAT)</dd>

        <dt>What is a common cause of inaccurate data?</dt>
        <dd>Biased data collecting methods.</dd>

        <dt>How can the accuracy of a primary source be determined?</dt>
        <dd>You can look at how reliable and trustworthy they are, and compare to other sources.</dd>

        <dt>With an example, explain the importance of timeliness in ensuring the quality and usability of data.</dt>
        <dd>A good example would be opinions of technology. Technology evolves quickly, so data that was collected perhaps a few years ago will no longer be as relevant.</dd>

        <dt>What influences the introduction of bias into data?</dt>
        <dd>There are many causes of bias, but commonly bias will be introduced when the person providing data has a vested interest.</dd>

        <dt>What is the difference between quantitative and qualitative data? Provide two examples.</dt>
        <dd>Qualitative data is data that is categorical (e.g. brands or worded rankings), and quantitative is numerical data (e.g. number of people in a room, or time spent driving).</dd>

        <dt>What strategies could be used when gathering quantitative data?</dt>
        <dd>Asking people to provide numbers (e.g. times) or measuring data.</dd>

        <dt>Provide an example of referencing based on APA.</dt>

        <dt>Why is it important to obtain permission when collecting data?</dt>
        <dd>Because the information produced will likely be shared, and without permission, this is violating others' privacy.</dd>

        <dt>What is the purpose of consent forms?</dt>
        <dd>They allow the person completing a survey to get an understanding of the purpose of the survey, and how the data will be handled.</dd>
